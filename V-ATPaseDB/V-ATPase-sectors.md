## V-ATPase sectors

- a sector (sometimes called domain) is a group of protein subunits that share a common function or position in a fully assembled and functional quaternary protein structure

- the V<sub>o</sub> sector is a subdomain of integral membrane subunits that catalyze proton translocation across the membrane

- the subscript in the V<sub>o</sub> is for historical reasons the lowercase letter 'o'

- V<sub>1</sub> sector is a subdomain of peripheral membrane subunits that catalyze ATP hydrolysis

- chemical potential energy from ATP hydrolysis is coverted to mechanical energy used to rotate the central stalk that connects the V<sub>1</sub> sector to the V<sub>o</sub> sector

- the *c* subunits of the V<sub>o</sub> sector rotate in the plane of the membrane like carousel while the V<sub>o</sub> *a* subunit remains fixed
